**This method is different from the method of directly combining scan context and f-loam in the following two points:**
**1. The method uses an adaptive threshold to further judge the loop closure detection results, reducing false loop closure detections;**
**2. This method uses feature point-based matching to calculate the constraints between a pair of loop closure frame point clouds, so that this method only needs 30% of the time consumption of SC-A-LOAM in the process of constructing loop frame constraints.**

# Optimized-SC-F-LOAM
This work combines F-LOAM with Scan-Context and optimizes it to reduce the time required to compute pose constraints between a pair of loop closure point clouds to 28% of Simple-SC-F-LOAM.(Simple-SC-F-LOAM is a way to directly combine F-LOAM with Scan-Context)
